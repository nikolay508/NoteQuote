# NoteQuote - A Social Media for Notes and Quotes

## ℹ️ About the project
NoteQuote is a platform where users can share and discover inspiring quotes and helpful notes with their friends. Whether it's a motivational quote, a thought-provoking note, or something you’d like to share with a friend, NoteQuote allows you to connect through words in a simple yet powerful way. This project was developed with a friend's idea and it offers both a dynamic front-end with React and TailwindCSS and a fully functional back-end with Node.js, Express and Supabase to bring a seamless experience to users.
