# NoteQuote - A Social Media for Notes and Quotes

## ℹ️ About the project
NoteQuote is a platform where users can share and discover inspiring quotes and helpful notes with their friends. Whether it's a motivational quote, a thought-provoking note, or something you’d like to share with a friend, NoteQuote allows you to connect through words in a simple yet powerful way. This project was developed with a friend's idea and it offers both a dynamic front-end with React and TailwindCSS and a fully functional back-end with Node.js, Express and Supabase to bring a seamless experience to users.

## 👨🏼‍💻 Project Setup & Start Guide

This guide explains how to start both the server and the client of the project so it can be ready for use.

### 🤖 First: Installation and start the server side:

1. Install dependencies for the REST-API server:

    Open Terminal, navigate and install:
    - cd back-end
    - npm i (install)

3. Start the REST-API server:
    - npm run dev

✔️ If everything is normal you will see the following messages:

   Server is running on port 5173    

### ⭐ Second: Installation and start the client side:

1. Install dependencies for the client (SPA):

    Open Terminal, navigate and install:
    - cd front-end
    - npm i (install)

3. Start the Application:
    - npm run dev

✔️ If everything is normal you will see the following messages:

VITE v6.2.1  ready in 821 ms
    <br>Local:   http://localhost:5173/
    <br>Network: use --host to expose
    <br>press h + enter to show help

Ensure the REST API server is running before starting the SPA to enable proper integration.
